= Pascal Notes and Examples

These are my personal tips, notes and examples that deals with _Object Pascal_ (specifically Free Pascal and some Lazarus IDE).

See the other Asciidoc file https://github.com/williamhunter/pascal_notes-and-examples/blob/master/pascal_notes-and-examples.adoc[here]

[NOTE]
This is a work in progress, I'm also learning Asciidoc as I go along...
